## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
    t1 <- c(3,  7,  9,   6,   -1)
    t2 <- c(6,  9,  12,  13,   5)
    t3 <- c(4,  8,  3,  -1,   -3)
    t4 <- c(1,  4,  7,   2,   -2)
    t5 <- c(5,  7,  9,   4,    2)
    t6 <- c(-3, 5,  8,   9,    4)
    t7 <- c(3,  6,  9,   4,    1)
    
    lista <- list(t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7)
    
    lista
    
    
    lapply(lista, min)
    print("MAXIMO ")
    lapply(lista, max)
```
